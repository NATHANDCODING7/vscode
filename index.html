    <h2>Morning Drop Off/Arrival Procedures</h2>
    <p>Morning Drop Off/Arrival Procedures
Students can enter the building beginning at 8:50 a.m. Students are not to arrive at school prior to this time since there is no supervision of students until 8:50 a.m. There will be staff assigned to bus and car duties all year.</p>
<br><br>
    <h2>Car Riders</h2>
  <p>  Car Riders:
If you drive your child to school, all car riders are to enter on the east side of the building, off Essington Road. When drivers enter the school entrance off Essington, the traffic flow pattern is to turn right to enter the drop off/parking area in front of the school. An area is set up directly in front of the main doors for student drop off. Cars are to pull up right next to the curb. THIS IS A MOVING LINE ONLY. All cars will be asked to enter the lane and pull all the way forward before allowing students to leave the vehicles on the CURBSIDE ONLY. Once the cars in the line are emptied, they will pull forward and exit the area and a new line of cars will enter the lane. No vehicles will be permitted to leave the lane by passing the cars in front of them.</p> 

<br><br>
    <h2>Bus Riders</h2>   
 <p> Bus Riders:
All busses will enter the Liberty property via Emily Drive. Buses will pull up to the back of the building and the students will unload and enter the building. Staff will be on hand to direct students as needed.</p>
<br><br>
    <h2>Walkers</h2>   
 <p> Walkers:
Students who are walkers may enter the school building in the back (D doors) or through the main entrance doors (A doors).</p>
 
<br><br>
  <p>Dismissal/Pick-up Procedure
      Students will be dismissed at 3:40 p.m.</p>
<br><br>
    <h2>Car Riders and Walkers</h2>
  <p>Car Riders and Walkers:
All car riders will be dismissed first, followed by walkers. Car riders will exit out the main entrance doors (A doors) and walkers will exit out the back of the building (D doors). If your child is a walker or bicycle rider, we ask that you wait by the bicycle rack/rock area to alleviate congestion by the doors.</p>
